            The game is played by two to five players.
            Each player has to choose a name and a colour.
            Players take turns placing tiles on the board, the first player to start is the first player that connects to the specific room.
            Tiles can be placed only on empty cells and only on cells adjacent to one of the other tiles of the player.
        </div>
        
        <div class="para">
            Each player is given three influence cards at the beginning of the game. A player can use any of their influence cards when making a
            move.
            Once a card is used, it is discarded (i.e. each influence card can be used at most once by each player).
            An influence card makes an exception from the previous rule.

        <div class="para">
            Double-move card: allows the player to place two stones in one move. (In terms of the adjacency rule, this move is interpreted as two
            consecutive moves.)
            <br>
            Replacement card: allows the player to place a stone even if the cell is not empty. The adjacency rule still applies.
            <br>
            Freedom card: allows the player to place a stone on any empty cell, even if it is not adjacent to their existing stones.
        </div>
        
        <div class="para">
            A player is called 'blocked' if they cannot make a move, even if using one of the influence cards available to them. If a player is
            blocked,
            they skip their turn.
            The game ends when all the players are blocked.
            The winner of the game is the player with the highest number of stones on the board. If there are several such players, the one of them
            who
            joined the game last, wins.
